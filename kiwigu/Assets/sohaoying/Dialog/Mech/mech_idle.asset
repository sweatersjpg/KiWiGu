  - This armor is... reaaaally uncomfortable.
  - Recruits get mad when I tell them to polish their boots - do they even KNOW how
    long it takes to polish this whole suit of armor?
  - Y'know, a lot of people have to pay their way to get to my rank. Not me. My dad
    did it for me.
  - I've had to pee for like an hour but it just takes so long to get out of this
    thing.
