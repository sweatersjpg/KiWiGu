  - I'm really glad they gave us boots, because to be honest with you? I never learned
    how to tie shoes.
  - Well, it was either this or working freighters in the outer ring. And we all

    on ALL THE TIME?
  - I think I've forgotten what real food tastes like. I actually had a dream last
    night about eating a ration pack.
  - 'Yeah, I''m not really a great shot. But I''ve got one skill the corp really
    needs:

    I can stand around and talk to myself for a loooong time.'
